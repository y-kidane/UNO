<!-- Group Work
To help plan your work, and make expectations explicit, discuss the following:

Where, and how often will you meet while working?
meeting in Ångström when possible, aim for 3 times a week.

How do you communicate in the group - what channels? - when?
we will use discord to communicate, in a private chat because we are only 2 members in the group

How will you use version control (git) and other tools you might agree on, like Trello or OverLeaf?
we will use git and github for version management, and Overleaf for the documentation and essay.

How do you coordinate the final hand-in?
we will both check the final deliverables and do independent checking before a discussion, when both parties are
satisfied with the work, 1 of us will hand in the deliverables for the whole group.

How do you ensure everyone knows what they should do after their current task, and what everyone else is working on?
we have a checklist for backlog and things we need to complete by certain times, and this checklist is visible to all members of the group

Dealing with Surprises
Communication in a group is very important, and at the same time often turns out to be very difficult, especially if something unexpected happens. Discuss at least the following:

What should you do if somebody feels left outside?
have a discussion, check with eachother on what parts we are working on, and if the person feeling left out maybe could get a task to work on. solve trough good communication.

What should you do if someone gets stuck on their current task?
if someone is stuck, we will have a call, and look at the code together and check if we both can solve it together, if were still stuck we google it.

What happens if someone feels another person isn’t doing their fair share?
we will check eachothers progress, and if someone is slacking me might redistribute tasks to even the workload.

What happens if someone is not communicating in the manner or frequency agreed upon?
make contact with that person, and ask them to communicate with the agreed upon channel.  -->
